Well, just setup my first weblog on Github.
As a 34 years old man, I just decided to dive in the coding world.
_"Write the code, change the world"_
Yes it is. We are now in the middle of *Infomation age*, this time we can own the power to *Make* things by just sitting in front of a laptop and hit some strokes.
I don't think learning is such a pain. Having some basic knowledge of programming in high school, I was able to code sth. useful by googling:) *AND THAT IS FUN!* Check out some of my work at "Github":https://github.com/soimy
So I setup a blog on github, just trying to record my steps on the road to a developer.

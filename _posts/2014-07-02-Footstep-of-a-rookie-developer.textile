Well, just setup my first weblog on Github.

As a 34 years old man, I just decided to dive in the coding world.

bq. _Write the code, change the world_

Yes it is. We are now in the middle of *Information age*, this time we can own the power to *Make* things by just sitting in front of a laptop and hit some strokes. I don't think learning is such a pain. Having some basic knowledge of programming in high school, I was able to code something useful by googling:) *AND THAT IS FUN!* Check out some of my work at "Github":https://github.com/soimy

So I setup a blog on github, just trying to record my steps on the road to a
developer.

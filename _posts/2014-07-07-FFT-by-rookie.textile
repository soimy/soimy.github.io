p(meta). 7 July 2014 - Shanghai

Our team is working on a multimedia project for "*new Shanghai Natural Museum*":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lHkavYwlPM . One of the multimedia software was designed to simulate different kinds of animal sounds via mic and score it... I just wanna say: _"Well done Buddy! Imagine the museum hall full of all kinds of strange wuuuuf ;)"_

As expected, we are unable to find any developer willing to take this strange job. So I decided to try it myself.

Well, I admit I escaped from Math class in university just for playing CS. Don't ask me how I managed to pass the exams:) But now I'm facing the consequence.

_(To be continued...)_
